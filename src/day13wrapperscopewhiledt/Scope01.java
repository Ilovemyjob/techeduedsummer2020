			/*
			 Scope means where to use variables
			 1)If you create a variable inside the class body and outside the methods
			   you can use them in everywhere inside the class.
			   Note: The variables created inside the class body and outside the
			         methods are called "Instance Variables".
			         num1 is an instance variable, num1 can be used from every where 
			         inside the class.
			 2)If you create a variable inside a method you can use it just inside 
			   that method. Inside the other methods, it cannot be used 
			   Note: The variables created inside a method are called "Local Variables"
			         "ch" is a local variable   
			         
			 Question: What is the difference between "Instance Variable" and 
			           "Local Variable"?    
			           ==> Local variables must be initialized(Assigning a value) 
			               but if you want you may not initialize instance variables. 
			 3)If you create a variable inside the method parentheses it is called
			   local variable as well and you can use it just inside the method body. 
			   i and j can be used just inside the subtract() method body    
			 4)Do not try to use a variable before declaration
