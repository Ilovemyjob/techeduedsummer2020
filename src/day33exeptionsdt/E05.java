	 What is the difference between "throw" and "throws" keywords?
	 
	 1)"throw" is used inside the method body, "throws" is used between method parentheses
	   and the opening curly brace
	 2)After "throw" we type ==> new + constructor of exception class 
	   After "throws" we type ==> name of the exception class
	 3)We can throw multiple exceptions by using just one "throws" keyword
	   We cannot throw multiple exceptions by using just one "throw" keyword.
	   If you want to throw more than 1 exceptions by using "throw" keyword you have to type 
	   "throw" per each 
	 4)"throws" is used for the possible problems which Java knows
	   "throw" is used for the possible problems which we decide.
