JAVA PRACTICE DAY_01
-What you will learn?
We will practice the same topics you learned in JAVA class.
Nothing new topic will be taught.
MAIN COURSES IN THE PROGRAM: Full Stack Automation Engineer(UI, API, Database), Software Developer In Test
*JAVA => Programming language. It is an Object Oriented Programming.
Why do you learn JAVA?
To write our automation code. Automation Testers will have to know at least one language.
Why JAVA 8?
Java 8 already has the major Java updates. It is not easy for big companies to update there tools. Change is difficult.
*SELENIUM => (To create an automation framework= The folders, codes, classess that you create to test an application\)
-TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, etc. (Different Framework Type)
*API => (Application Programing Interface)
-Manual Api Testing(Postman)
-Automation Api Testing (Rest)
*Database => (SQL = structures query language)
*Additional Tools
Eclipse, Intellij, Git, Jira, ...
Why eclipse???
-Popular.
-Eclipse helps us to write , run , and debug our code.
Why not just notepad?
Becuyuse you can not run, debug, deploy your code with notepad.
Alternatives : IntelliJ
A couple recommendations:
1. Type, type and type.
2. Practice a lot.
3. You need to understand and be very good at the Java Basics.
4. Be a good researcher. Google has anything we need.
5. Do not miss any class.
In every company you will be having:
Projects
Packages
Classes
Methods
Variables
Common puctuations in JAVA
() : paranthesis => methods
[] : square brackets => in the main method.
'' : single quote => char. takes a single character
"" : double quote=> String.
;  : semi colon=> after each sentences, variables, etc. like a.
// : double slash=>comment out

public class Practice_01 {
    //Everyone should know how to type main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
//public static =>access modifies. access able form anywhere in the project. 
//Main method is always public static
//main method name
//void => return type. Void=no special return type. return type examples: int, String, boolean, 
//args => argument= anything run with that
//String[]= String of Array
      
      //What is main method?
      //Engine of a car. Without main method, we cannot run any code.
     //Do we have to have a main method to build and run an application?
      //Yes we need main to build and run an application
      
      //Hay many data type are there in JAVA?
      //2. Primitive and Non primitive
      //How manu primitive data type are there?
      //8: boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, double
      //NOTE: all primitives start with a small letter
      
      //Please declare all the primitive data types?
      //declare variable first
      boolean b; //b=true
      //assign a value after
      b=true;
      //can i turn the value of b = false
      b=false;
      
      boolean th=true;
      
      //In Java every character has a value. Even whitespace
      char c;
      c=' ';
      
      byte by;
      short s;
      
      //int => Data Type , i => variable(container), 1 => value.
      //variables are important in JAVA. 
      //Because, we create object/variable and use them 
      //in our codes to make our code DYNAMIC
      //Dynamic code means we are usign variables or parameters in our code.
      
      //Also to use the same value again and again
      int i=-4;
      long l;
      float f;
      double d;
      
      //print int 
      //We have to initialize the variables to print the values.
      System.out.println("The current value of the integer is => "+i); 
      
     //Find the minimum and maximum value of a short. Use the same variable s
      s=Short.MIN_VALUE;
      System.out.println("The Smallest Value of a short => "+s);
      s=Short.MAX_VALUE;
      //s=32765;
      //We are printing dynamically
      System.out.println("The Biggest Value of a short => "+s);
      //Hard coded: you have to change the actual code to change the result
      System.out.println("The Biggest Value of a short => 32767");
