	 What is the difference between "final", "finally", and "finalize()"?
	 
	 1)final: We can use "final" keyword for a) variable  ==> Their values cannot be updated
	                                         b) method    ==> The body of final methods is
	                                                          in its final state, it means you
	                                                          cannot update the body of the
	                                                          final method. If you cannot update
	                                                          the body overriding is not 
	                                                          meaningful. Because of that Java 
	                                                          does not allow to override final 
	                                                          methods
	                                         c) class     ==> Final classes cannot be inherited
	                                                          It means a final class cannot be
	                                                          parent class or a final class
	                                                          cannot have child classes
	 2)finally: We can use "finally" code block after try-catch block. It runs under
	            every condition. For example; to cut connection with the cloud we can use
	            finally code block.
	 3)finalize(): We can use finalize() method to make the unused objects ready to be 
	               destroyed by Garbage Collector. When we call finalize() method it is 
	               not certain finalize() method will run. Java decides when and how to 
	               run finalize().
