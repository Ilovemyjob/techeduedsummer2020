		 1) Set: In Set all elements must be unique, you cannot use repeated elements in a Set
		 2) We have 3 types of Sets in Java
		    a)HashSet
		    b)LinkedHashSet
		    c)TreeSet
		 3) HashSet: Uses "hash ing technique" 
		             Does not maintain any order, it returns elements in random order.
		             When you try to add repeated elements, Java does not give Compile Time Error
		             or Run Time Error. Java overwrites the new element to the old one. 
		             Adding null as an element in a HashSet is allowed. If you try to add "null" more than 
		             once Java will overwrite 
		             
		             ==> HashSet does not put elements in any order, it means HashSet does not work on 
		             ordering elements, it saves time for HashSet because of that HashSet is faster than 
		             LinkedHashSet and TreeSet. If the order of elements is not important for your program
		             use HashSet to be fast.
