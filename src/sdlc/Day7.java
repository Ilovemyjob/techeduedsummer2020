Recruiters => the companies submitting your resume to IT companies or diferent end clients
End clients => Companies hiring you => direct apply
when you have a direct apply, it takes longer time

Most important things we got here;
She mentioned about interview process
mentoring sessions 
search things on google
if you have a topic, at least say a few words even if you do not know
self-study
replit questions
White box => is concerning the interternal structure of the codes being typed by Developers
=>You should definitely have technicl knowledge
e.g. => unit test
Black box testing => this is directly related to application itself 
and does not requiere much technical knowledge.
it can be done either by tech people like automation testers also by functional testers
smoke test , regression test
UA testing 
end-to-end testing
functional testing
smoke test => critical functionalies
regression test => minor and mijar regressions 
all functionalities being added, should be tested together
2 testing techniques:
equivilance partitioning
catagorize the items(test data)
Then test at least one example from each
Boundary value analysis:
testing min and max values
When you find a bug, what do you do?
You reproduce and make sure it is a legitimate bug(valid bug)
Then you can ask your tester friends if they face the same issue
Then I ask the issue to Developer to see if it is a real bug or not before reporting
Where do you create a bug ticket?
We use Jira to manage the project and track our defects 
Jira 
and 
JiraXray => upgraded version and has more functions
As you know that Jira is really great tool to tack bugs, 
I can also learn any other project management tool if necessary
