 -----------------TERM IN AGILE SCRUM:-------------------
-Functionality:(part of application) It is a part of an application such as Log In functionality, 
check out functionality, search functionality,  logout, submit, return, upload, sign up, filter.... 
TESTERS TESTS THESE FUNCTIONALITIES.

--EPIC(FEATURE)   :It is big part of the application. High level description of a functionality

--USER STORY(very important )  (homepage)    :It is smaller part of an epic. 
Detailed certain part of an application. 
It is not logical for a U.S. to be more than 1 sprint.
 The goal of creating user story is to complete them before the sprint ends. 
In Scrum, every user story has its own estimated points.
 The points will be given by the devs, and testers.

-ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:(very important ) The requirement in the user stories. 
This explains how the application should work.

EXAMPLE: US: As user, i should be able to log in the application.
A.C.: Username should not include any special character
Password should include capital letter, and special characters.

As testers,or devs, we cannot add or change 
the user stories or acceptance criteria. 
BUT WE CAN PROVIDE FEEDBACK.

Product Backlog:(all document)It is kind of a storage.
 All ready epics and user stories are in the Products Backlog

Sprint Backlog :All of the User stories for that sprint will be in the sprint backlog.
 This has only the user stories that will be developed and tested for that specific sprint. 
 All of the user stories should be completed with in that sprint.
  Sprint backlog items comes from Product backlog.

 How many point can a tester take in 2 weeks of sprint(10 work days)? 
 It depends. It should be similar or same to the number of days in a sprint. 
 In some sprint, you can take 15, some other times 10, maybe 5 points.

 Epics Usually can not be developed in a short period of time. 
 It usually takes more than 2 weeks. Epics are broken into U.S .
 becuase it makses the development easier and in details.
  Epics may or may nor completed in one sprint.

=Sprint: Times in scrum development. Certain time periods to develop certain user stories.
 1 week, 2 weeks, 3weeks, 4 weeks. It depends on the company. 
Business decides how long sprint will be. Once the decision made, sprint duration will not CHANGE.
