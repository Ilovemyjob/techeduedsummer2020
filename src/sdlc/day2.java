	When we have an application:
We need to consider business user / end-clients' expectations

Plan:  Create an application that serves millions of people for transportation  
(moving from a place to another place ) like => Uber

Application must be reachable everywhere(Germany, France and USA)
   a)Location
   b)network
   c)Language preference
   d)payment options
Hire team members for our software application
	a)developers
	b)Testers
	c)BA
	d)PM
	e)Designers (Solution Architects)
	f)Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
Hire Drivers and customer service agents
	a)Trusty and quality drivers
	b)necessary tools and cars
Work with some finincial companies to assure risks
	a)promotions and security options(help)
	insurance
	
 Designing phase: 
DDS => Design Document Specification

Building part =>
Developers are expected to write high quality codes
 
Testing phase:(flow)
 .You face an unexpected behavior =>
username and password =>
username should not allow digits => Soner1234
 .we have a defect
The functionality is not matching the requirement

 .Then you should report it
It goes back to Devs
 .track => our functionality that has defect
 .retest => the  functionality
Finally the defect is gone
.defect => while testing the application,= you can find unexpected behavior and it is called defect
.Bug => when the unexpected behavior =comes from end-clients
The functionality is matching the requirement now

interview
..When you find a defect and say that it is a defect then 
the developer says it is not a legitimate defect(It is not a defect)what would you do?
(This answer is for interview)
.Retesting = reproducing the bug => manually or automating
.First I share the defect with tester friends
.KT => Knowledge Transfer session => They say yes it is a defect
.I will ask the developer that I faced something like that(not other)
.No it is not a bug then report
.If he or she says yes it is a bug    (legitimes = real bug)

interview
Where do you track your defects?
Jira => I use Jira(Tool)

Deployment is done and end-users got the application
Then if we have feedbacks from customers
Then we get the at Maintanence
When you have a new version created then you release it and this process is called deployment

SRS => Sofware Requirement Specification => BRD and FRD
Business requirement document and Functional requirement document

Until now we talked about SDLC
We have 2 different methodolgies for project to be executed
..Waterfall Method vs Agile methodology

Waterfall
.Once the application is created and everything is done
Then the testing phase starts
At that point if the customers are not satisfied with the application and 
they send their feedbacks, it is so hard to go back and fix them
.=>The testing part is the most considerable disadvantage of the waterfall method

interview
Which methodology do you prefer to use?
I know both of the methodologies and can work in any enviroment
Actually I am pretty good at both of them, but Agile is more user-friendly
Waterfall does not welcome new changes and updates

It is not a good method for longer projects
It is useful for short term projects
It is easier to manage the project
there is PM in waterfall but not in agile
The most common one is Agile

                 ........     SDLC phase ..........
Planning => We are giving high level points for theapplication (Planning the app)
Defining => we are documenting all detailed plans in this stage
Designing => We follow the instructions and we provide different desgins models for the application
Building => The developers are building the application with their high quality codes (scripts)
Testing => We are checkin if the requirements are matched and the application meets SDLC standards
Deploymet => We are releasing the application to clients (end-users, end-clients)
Also once there are feedbacks, we update them at Maintanence
