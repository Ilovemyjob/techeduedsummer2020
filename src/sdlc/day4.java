Waterfall method =>
It is easier to manage
It is better to be used for short term projects

We prefer both of them and I am familiar with both of them
Agile is a common process to manage projects and it userfriendly

user stories => smaller description of functionalities

When you choose the product backlog items for a sprint,
they are now in your sprint backlog

Development team  => points the user stories

P.O. => decides which user stories will be chosen
They are not manager of the team, they are just representative of the business

Sm => manages the progress and pointing within the meeting
(between dev team and product owner)
Scrum master => is the one who facilitates everything for the team
just manage the meetings and facilitates everything 
for the scrum team (scrum master+Product owner)

Development team is a self-orgonized team that manage the work progress

Where do we have the user stories we have pointed?--when we working
We have them in sprint backlog   

Whenever your sprint duration is decided, you can no longer change!
It can not be changed!
Sprint duration  => 2-4 weeks

Product backlog => it is kind of storage, we have all our epics and user stories
that we will work on during the project

Sprint backlog => we have all the user stories we will work on during the sprint

When you have not completed all user stories, 
the remaining user stories will be added to the Product backlog.-to make new point

Burn down chart => shows you the progress of the work during a sprint

------------------The Scrum Events => all meetings------------------

Sprint planning meeting(en basta) =>
is the first meeting where you point the user stories and 
choose what product backlog items you will be working on during the spring

who decides what product backlog items will be chosen?
Product owner.
who decides how many product backlog items will be seleted for the next sprint?
Development team.

Daily-scrum(Stand-up meeting) =>
We chech the progress of all team members on daily basis.(yesterday today prb)
we talk about what we did yesterday and what we will be doing today
we also talk about any impediments(problem/issue) that we face.
It takes about 15 minutes.

Sprint review (sprint demo) meeting =>(after spring)
we have all team members and the business people (stakeholders), 
then someone from the QA(showing) team would demo everything 
at the end of the sprint to business people.

Sprint Retrospective =>(EVALUATE PREVIOUS))-EVERY SPRING
we talk about what we did well and keep doing
we talk about what could be improved- (scrumteam)
Also we talk about any impediments(prb) if we have so(selamlama)
This is mostly done in the next sprint

If your sprint is 2 weeks, it is always a mature team structure
If your sprint is 3 weeks, it is more flexible than the previous one
If your sprint is 4 weeks, it might look like your team is really flexible

FN:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
 8
 next time similar funktional=> 5
 
 You should always give your self 1 point to analyse then user story
 so you should at least give 2 points for any user storypackage ibrahimsettar;
